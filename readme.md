# Topper finding & Matrix Multiplication in C

## Overview

This repository contains two C programs:

1. **Topper**: A program to manage student information (ID, name, marks, average) and display the student with the highest average.
2. **Matrix**: A program that performs matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation and pointers.

## Assignment 1: Topper finding

### Description:
- Uses a structure (`Student`) to hold student information.
- Functions to input data, calculate average marks, and display the topper.

### Features:
- Input for 5 students.
- Calculate average marks.
- Identify the topper (student with the highest average).

# Assignment 2: Matrix Multiplication (Pointers + Dynamic Memory Allocation + Functions)

## Description

This program implements matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and functions in C. The program performs the following tasks:

- Accepts two matrices as input.
- Validates whether the multiplication is possible (i.e., the number of columns of Matrix A must equal the number of rows of Matrix B).
- Multiplies the matrices and stores the result in a third matrix.
- Displays the resulting matrix.

### How to Run:
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc topper.c -o topper

   ```bash
   gcc matrix.c -o matrix
